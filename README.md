# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to look at differences in the data between city types.  Doing so will allow us to better understand rider and driver trends for each type of location.  As a result of the analysis, I was asked to visualize the data in a way that tells a story to decision makers.  

## Results
### Summary DataFrame
For the Summary DataFrame, I was asked to calulate some statistics for each city type.  In the Summary DataFrame, I have included the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver.  What I found was that the urban cities had the highest quantities in the raw stats, but te lowest averages.  The rural dempgraphic's statistics were the inverse: low raw stats, but high averages.  The Suburban market segment landed in the middle in all categories.  The urban market is an important market segment, but with Total Drivers being higher than Total Rides, it looks like the market is oversaturated.  The rural market could use more drivers, however, as the rides are very profitable on an average fare basis.  Below is the DataFrame for reference:

### Total Fare Line Chart
For the line chart tracking Total Fares, I tracked Total Fares from 1/1/2019 to 4/28/2019.  I dod notice one universal peak in the data for all city types.  It looks like late February was a popular time for PyBer.  It is clear that the majority of revenue comes from the Urban market segment.  This is expected due to the population density of urban cities and expenses of car ownership in urban areas.  Below is the chart showing weekly fare totals for each city type:

## Summary
My recommendations for PyBer should help them maximize their resources for revenue generation.  The first is to move some drivers from the urban areas to suburban and rural areas.  This will likely require incentivizing these locations for drivers.  This would solve the oversaturation of urban markets and undersaturation of suburban and rural markets.  The second recommendation is to suggest a marketing campaign for PyBer in suburban and rural markets, allowing the company to increase the total fares of these areas, utilizing the high average scroes as a way to increase overall revenue.  The third recommendation is The third recommendation is to introduce a pooling option (multiple riders for one driver) in suburban areas to alleviate the driver shortage.  This is not being recommeded for rural areas, however, because the area is too sparse that ride pooling would have too negative of an impact on ride times.
